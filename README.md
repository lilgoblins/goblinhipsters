# Goblin Hipsters

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```


npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/deploy.js

npx hardhat verify 0xa1AA3dADc91C1d46E649Ab3AA7966b751bF5ec6c --network rinkeby   "Goblin Hipsters"    "GOHIP"    "0x3F9d77A79977453Ca51d386d8bd99e05b6109fAC"    "0x3F9d77A79977453Ca51d386d8bd99e05b6109fAC"
